Tiger King CTF 2020 (organized on May 1, 2020 online) ( https://tigerking.threatsims.com/) is a CTF orginized by Threat Simulations and RunCode.ninja during Derpcon 2020. We participated under the team name CoronHack. We now have a team name on CTFTime which is Bl4ckEnergy.
The challenges consisted of web exploitation, cryptography, forensics, Linux system exploitation and others challenges whose names were little more personalized (RunCode.ninja, Trainer, Survey) which are among others web challenges in general.
